A project using SQL to answer business questions surrounding the operations of a record store. I use subqueries, multiple joins, set operations, aggregate functions, and visualize some of my findings

Quick observations:
- The United States accounts for ~22% of sales
- Based on the data provided, the Czech Republic, the UK, and India present opportunities we can explore, but the sample size is small so we should be careful of overcommitting
